          <p>Hello there! I'm Eray Alkış.</p>
          <p>At the start of 2021, I discovered The Odin Project and App Academy Open, open source curriculums written by experienced developers that teach almost everything needed to become a capable full-stack developer.</p>
          <p>They both have amazing, well-written courses, and projects range from some hand-holding at the start to "Build a chess app from scratch!". I was fascinated and just <strong>had</strong> to learn how to do that.</p>
          <p>I spent every single day of the pandemic getting stuck again and again until I figured out how to get unstuck. I made tons of mistakes and learned something from each one.</p>
          <p>More recently though, I've been focused on learning other programming languages and mobile development.</p>

          <br/>
          <p>Currently, I'm looking to join a close-knit team that would welcome a detail-oriented, ambitious fast learner.</p>
